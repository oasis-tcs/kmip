== KMIP 1.4 update (Tony C.) ==
 * Tony: Hand it over to Anthony to go over the Export/Import proposal
 * Anthony: Submitted the proposal for export/import on the reflector
 * Mark: How are the attributes handled during export/import because different server implementations may handle them differently or may not understand all the attributes. Clearly state and add error code.
 * Bob L. :This should be included in the usage guide
 * Tim H. : Server vendors do not support mandatory attributes during registration
 * Bruce: We can leverage query, query attributes before export to ensure that import will go through smoothly
 * Tony: Let us table this in KMIP 2.0, include fine-grained response and error codes and clarify registration operation
 * Anthony: Inclusion of template in the export is still planned as some server vendors may still require them
 * Tony: Will send the list of all deprecated items to Judy for the Usage Guide
 * Anthony: Sensitive and extractable attributes in line with PKCS, keys that never leave the server
 * Put a flag extractable - false means keys stay in the server and never leaves the server, sensitive can leave in wrapped format
 * Saikat: Keys are replicated between server nodes in servers in high availability mode, is it considered extractable?
 * Anthony: Servers should be treated as a logical unit, so all server nodes are part of that logical unit, hence high availability key replication of extractable key should be fine
 * Tony: Yes, this is how PKCS also behaves
 * Judy: This is outside the scope but a clarification note may be helpful
 * Saikat: Let us add some clarification note to make it clear
 * Mark: Agreed, let us add clarification

 * Wide and diverse list
 * Put it in the agenda for KMIP F2F in February

== KMIP 1.3 Votes (Hal L.) ==
 * Hal: Would like to re-visit the voting issue for KMIP 1.3
 * Hal: Two negative voting companies and one abstained company were mis-represented, Quintessance Lab and SafeNet are the two companies who had negative votes which are KMIP implementors of KMIP spec. Two important TC members. Is it possible to ask for feedback or reason for the negative votes or why they did not object earlier because it is is supposed to be a consensus of the community.
 * Jamie Clark: OASIS General Counsel, wearing the OASIS hat, anyone can vote 'NO' and they are not obligated to disclose any reasons for a negative vote. This is part of OASIS policy. Moreover, both of these parties are part of OASIS interoperability sub-committee which has an NDA in place for confidentiality
 * Tony: Mis-representation was not at all intended. Will anyone like to re-visit the earlier motion for a special majority ballot.
 * No comments, earlier motion for special majority ballot carries
