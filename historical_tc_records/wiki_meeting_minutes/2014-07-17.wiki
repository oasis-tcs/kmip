== NIST key lifecycle secure attributes discussion ==
 * Chuck: Based on NIST SP 800-130, secure the metadata.
 * Proposed a 2-phase approach, in the first phase, categorize attributes and mark them as secure attribute, server and/or client honors the security attribute to protect these attributes
 * Protect attributes using existing wrap/unwrap mechanism, to make it relatively seamless for server and client vendors, classify, mark attributes with x-, y- existing mechanism and then wrap/unwrap them as appropriate.
 * Joe: Concerned about deprecation and future interoperability, would prefer a more standardized way to deal with this. Using custom attribute x- format, different vendors will use different names which will cause interop issues
 * Tim: Suggest to handle this thru Usage guide
 * Chuck: Applicable to industry specific requirements as well, healthcare, DOD in public sector may have special attribute requirements
 * David Featherstone: Binding customer attributes to actual data, how about the authentication scheme, who is authenticated?
 * Chuck: This pertains to authorization scheme instead of authentication and might be too much to handle in the KMIP specification
 * Joe: We need to find best way to handle this in 1.3
 * Chuck: Also US classification guidelines will help to classify the secure or sensitive attributes
 * Chuck: Three things to deal with, first existing sensitive attributes, second security attributes from NIST 800-130 and third custom attributes that may be specific to given customer, for example, satellite communication
 * Saikat: Next step
 * Chuck: Read classification guidelines and propose how to identify the secure or sensitive attribute, would be great to include how KMIP 1.3 supports these secure attributes

 * Judy: Registration proposal, will not be ready next week
 * Tim: Query enhancements proposal, next week
 * Kiran: Group proposal in next two weeks, Kiran and Saikat to submit
