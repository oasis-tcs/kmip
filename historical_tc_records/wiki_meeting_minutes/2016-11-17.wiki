 * Proposal for client to be able to create secret data (Gerald S.)

  * Include both wrap/unwrap and plain text test cases to cover FIPS potential issues
 * XTS Handling Proposal (Tim H.)
  * Three options (Do nothing, break AES, Allow server to create 512 bits in two keys when XTS is create requested)
  * Problem is that wrapped keys can be stored that are larger than 256 bits as an AES key object
  * IEEE P1619 Std 2007 contains a specific recommendation for wrapping keys either individually or both as single object
  * Bob Lockhart (Bob L.) stresses the need for Option 1 based on pre-existing standards from IEEE and NIST
  * Judy is volunteering to create a profile with help from Tim H., Tim C. and review Bob L.
  * Preferred Option is Option 1 with additional documentation in usage guide and an appropriate profile
   * Test cases will be included
 * Test Cases uploaded for version 1.4 interop including draft Test Cases documentation
 * Profile document is uploaded and change to TLS to require TLS 1.2 removing 1.0 and 1.10
  * Removed Triple-DES as algorithm
  * Update of the base-line server requirements for specific attributes
 * Spec and Usage Guide updates
