== Extending Querry Operation - Mark J ==
 * Mark J: Want input from TC prior to creating a proposal such that a server returns the supported profiles including alternate service ports.
 * Bob Lockhart (Bob L): Are you saying servers don't support standard port of 5696?
 * Bruce Rich (Bruce): Are you suggesting using TTLV for query?
 * Mark J: The idea being that querry to find other service ports would be done in TTLV on standard or configured port for JSON, XLM or HTTPS ports if supported by the server (even if still using 5696).  Also looking at including profiles supported with attributes.
 * Saikat Saha (Saikat): could that have security implications as query doesn't have authentication requirements?
 * Mark J: Certificate already in place would that be enough
 * Bob L: there are clients that require specification optional 2nd authentication mechanism but shouldn't impact query.  We may want to consider or look at unauthenitcated query versus authenticated query.
 * Several would like to see a proposal by F2F if possible
