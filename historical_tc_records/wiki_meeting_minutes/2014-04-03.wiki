Roll call taken by Subhash, Quorum achieved

= Agenda =
 1. Link to available KMIP implementation on our wiki
 1. Status of public review comments

= Links to KMIP implementations =

Tony has received numerous inquiries about commercial and open source KMIP implementations. It might be a good idea to list what is available on our wiki; helps adoption.

Tim moves that we create a link on our wiki page that lists commercial and open source KMIP implementations with the following caveats:
 1. A disclaimer that indicates that the TC has not validated conformance
 1. A mechanism by which non TC members can actually get themselves added to the list (via KMIP comments)
Mark seconds.

Hearing no objections/abstentions, motion carries.

Since Bob L was late, it was unanimously decided that he would draft the disclaimer language.

= Comments =

Most comments are around 
 1. broken references
 1. Corrections to references
 1. Structure of profiles
 1. That the references don't go deep enough and stop @ just the document

Next week, we will look @ Bob's consolidated comment list.

= Next weeks agenda =

 1. Review consolidated spreadsheet (Bob L.)
 1. List of items that need to be deprecated (Bob L.)
 1. Proposal for new state model (Bob L.)

If Bob is unable to complete them, and if no other new materials are sent a day before next weeks call, then, I shall cancel the mtg.
